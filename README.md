# folder-password-protect
Simple program that allows you to Protect folders with password. 
How to use?
Put this .exe in a folder you want to protect and run it.

Q: Why is program nammed csrss? 
A: Because it will be almost imposible to find by someone who want to force disable protection.

Tips: You can protect as many folders as you want, recommended to change name everytime u copy it :D

So after a while i decided just to hide process from task manager.. but it just wont be ok.

Remember, to protect 2 folders with 2 different passwords, you need to have new csrss, that you didnt entered password in and made a copy of.
